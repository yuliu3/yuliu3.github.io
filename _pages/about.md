* I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computing at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).
  
* I recived my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from Stony Brook University, where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Prof. [Yuanyuan Yang](http://www.ece.sunysb.edu/~yang/).

* Prior to that, I received a Bachelor's degree in communications engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China.

* My research interests are centered around edge computing and networks, edge AI, LEO satellite networks, and distributed quantum computing.

*  I am currently recruiting self-motivated Ph.D. students. If you are interested in joining my research group, please feel free to reach out with your CV and transcripts to my email: yu-y.liu@polyu.edu.hk.
