* I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the ECE department at Stony Brook University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Yuanyuan Yang]([http://www.ece.sunysb.edu/~yang/]).

* I earned my Ph.D. degree from the [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), fortunately advised by Prof. [Pascal O. Vontobel](https://sites.google.com/site/pascalvontobel/). 

* Prior to that, I received a Bachelor's degree in communications engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)](http://en.hit.edu.cn/), Harbin, China.

* My research interests are centered around coding theory, signal processing, and statistical inference.
