* I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the ECE department at Stony Brook University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Yuanyuan Yang](http://www.ece.sunysb.edu/~yang/).

* Prior to that, I received a Bachelor's degree in communications engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China.

* My research interests are centered around edge computing and networks, edge AI, and distributed quantum computing.
